            <p class="what">Manity is a fast app launch and switch tool designed for OS X. </p>
            <p class="whatif">If you are a people who would like to use keyboard to make effective usage of operating system, Manity will help you to maximize your efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Why Manity</h2>
            <p>Manity is an easy to use app, you can learn how to use it without any configuration and study. Just remember, when you want to switch to an app, hold the Option key and press the target number, you will be switched to the target app immediately. If this app hasn't launched yet, Manity will also launch it.</p>
            <p>The idea of Manity comes from Ubuntu Unity desktop, if you've ever used Unity desktop and get used to the Super key feature, and want the same feature in OS X, then Manity is designed for you. This is also the initial goal why I developed Manity.</p>
            <p>In our daily computer life, we all have some app which will be used very frequently, like Finder, Safari (or other web browser)  or Terminal. Switch and use them should be direct, the old CMD+Tab switcher should only be used when switch to the not common used apps.</p>

            <h2>Purchase</h2>
            <p>You can use Manity for evaluated for free, but you must purchase a license to make it unlimited to use.</p>
            <p>Licenses are per-user, rather than per-machine, so you can enjoy Manity on as many computers and operating systems as you wish with your license.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>1. Can I custom the apps?</h3>

            <p>You aren't be able to custom in current version. All the apps will be loaded exactly the same of the items in Dock. I just want to keep the first version easy to use without configuration. In the future version, I will try to add the app customization.</p>

            <h3>2. Can I custom the hot key?</h3>
            <p>Manity uses the Option+Number combine key by default, this is the same as Unity desktop. This combine key is also not used by other application. I will also try to add more customization like this in the future version.</p>

            <h3>3. Why sometimes Manity hot key doesn't work?</h3>
            <p>Please check if your cursor is focus in the password input. Because of OS X's security mechanism, the option hot key will be disabled when password input field is focus.</p>

            <h3>4. How can I use the default Option feature?</h3>
            <p>The original Option+Number combine key will output the characters like: ™, £. If you nee to input these character, just double-click and hold Option key, now press other key, it will bring the original feature for you.</p>

            <h3>5. I have other question which is not listed here</h3>
            <p>Please leave your message here or send me an Email. Thank you!</p>
            <p>Special thanks to Unity desktop and Yi Gu, who gives the help during the development of Manity.</p>
